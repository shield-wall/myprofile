# How to run the project locally


I'm assuming that you have node **18** or higher installed in your machine.

```bash
npm install
npm run node:group:init
npm run dev
npm run node:group:pdf
```

### Preview

you can edit resume data in **data/data.yaml**

Note: you need to generate `json` and `pdf` again

```bash
npm run node:group:pdf
```
